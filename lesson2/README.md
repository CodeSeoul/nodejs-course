## What is HTTP Server?
HTTP server listens or waits for requests from clients and return responses.

## Develop Our First HTTP Server
Our first server always returns "Hello World".

### 1. Import Required Module
Use the `require` directive to load the `http` module and store the returned HTTP instance into an http variable.
```js
var http = require('http');
```

### 2. Create Server

Use the created http instance and call `http.createServer()` method to create a server instance.
It accepts a single argument, a callback function, that will be called on each HTTP request received by the server.
This callback function recevies, as arguments, the request and response objects, which are commonly shortened to `req` and `res`.

```js
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
 Â  res.end('Hello, World!'); // End the response with the message, "Hello, World!"
});
```

For every HTTP request received by the server, the callback funtion will be invoked with new `req` and `res` objects.


### 3. Listen to client's requests

Bind the server instance at port 8080 using the `listen` method associated with the server instance. 

```js
server.listen(8080);
```

## 4. Test Our First HTTP Server

Execute the [helloServer.js](helloServer.js) to start our first HTTP server.

```bash
$ node helloServer.js
Server running at http://localhost:8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in any browser and observe the result.

Or use the `curl` command on the terminal
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080
Hello, World!
```

Now, we have our first HTTP server up and running which is responding to all the HTTP requests at port 8080.

## Challenges
- Create a HTTP server which always returns 0 to 9.
